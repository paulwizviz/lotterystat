# Context

This section provides the context behind the project. This include:

* Project requirements
* Design decisions
* Quality considerations
* Project tracking

## Project requirements

This project objectives are to deliver:

* an macOS, Linux and Windows application (Codename **ebenezer**) 
* an RESTFul and GraphQL based API enabling third parties to build apps against it (Codename **richie**) 

## Design decisions

The design decisions influencing the architecture and deliverables of this project are guided by these methodologies:

* Design thinking and lean methodology
* Microservices implementation methodology, where appropriate
* The [go standard project layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) for source code architecture (see also the blog [Design the architecture, name the components, document the details](https://paulwizviz.github.io/go/2022/12/23/go-proverb-architecture.html))

## Quality considerations

This project is predominantly Go based. The principle as outlined in the official Go coding convention [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) is used to ensure consistencies in the source code architecture.

The Test Driven Development methodology is also used in this project.

## Project tracking

The project uses the kanban agile methodology to manage the development lifecycle. Please refer to [Pivotal tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2639054) for tracking.
