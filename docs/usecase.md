# Use case

One approach to building an application is to feastures and functionality that are receptive to its intended user. Base on this prediction, we build the application and deliver it to the market.

For this project, we are using a different approach. One that combines the principles of [lean startup methodology](https://theleanstartup.com/principles) and [design thinking](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/5-stages-in-the-design-thinking-process). 

The key principles behind the lean startup approach is to build a product in an iterative way. At the heart of this approach is the notion of a [Minimum Viable Product (MVP)](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html) is defined as that version of a product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort. 

In other words, an MVP is a version of a product that we build with minimum effort and set features to build and we deliver so our customer can tell us if they will find it useful, and in a commercial setting would pay to have the apps. If thay version does not find a receptive user, we will iterate or even pivot to offer a new version.

To augment the lean startup methodology, we use the design thinking methodology to which is to help us target more precisely our application to that aspect that matters to its beneficiary. The key principles behind the methodology is a human-centred approach to design our product involving the use of personas. [Personas](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/personas-why-and-how-you-should-use-them) are fictional characters, which you create based upon your research to represent the different user types that might use your service, product, site, or brand in a similar way.

The use of personas helps us through empathy and understanding identify the needs of our target users. From there identify the features that we'll incorporate into our MVP.

The process to derive an MVP is a subject beyond the scope of this project. So we'll not explain how we identified the personas and their needs. You can refer to this [article](https://medium.com/pushtostart/from-lean-startup-via-design-thinking-to-implementation-70ee3b75e738) explaining the process. For the purpose of this project, we'll be building our lottery stat against personas that we have already identified.

For this project, we have identified Alice and Bob as our personas representing users of initial interation of our MVP.

## Alice

Alice is a frontend developer who intends to build a web-base application to enable her customers analyse the results of the UK lottery draws. 

<u>Alice technical background</u>

Alice is familiar with developing applications against a RESTFul API pattern based on the princples described [here](https://restfulapi.net/rest-architectural-constraints/).

<u>Our MVP</u>

We will deliver a cloud based RESTFul API codename `ebenezer` (shortname `ebz`).

## Bob

Bob would like an application that he can install on his macOS that will enable him to perform statistical analysis of lottery draws.

<u>Bob's technical background</u>

Bob is familiar with using command line interface (cli) based application.

<u>Our MVP</u>

We will deliver a cli base application codename `richie`.
