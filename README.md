# Overview

Use this template to scaffold a project for creating macOS, Linux and Windows native app or Docker base app incorporating a Web-based frontend (e.g. ReactJS, Vue, etc) with a web and RESTFul server.

## How do I scaffold a project from this template?

At the top this page, you should see a green coloured button named `Use this template`. Click on the button and follow the instructions from Github.

## What do I get out-of-the-box when I create a scaffold?

You'll get the following:

* A ReactJS-based skeleton sub-project.

* A layout based on [Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)

* A skeleton Go source code to generate webserver and RESTful server.

* Docker based build scripts to help you create native (macOS, Linux and Windows) app or Docker image app.

* A locally deployable development environment to help you see the interactions between your web source code and Go RESTFul API

## Prerequisite

In order to build apps based on this template, you **must** install Docker and Docker compose.

You should also install the following items to help you edit source codes:

* [Go toolkit version 1.11 onwards](https://blog.golang.org/)

* Node

**NOTE:** These toolkits are not use to build your projects.

## How do I extend/modify my scaffold?

Please refer to the [architecture docs](./docs/Arch.md)

## How do I build my project?

Please refer to the [build doc](./docs/Build.md).

## How do I see my projects in action?

Please refer to [running the app doc](./docs/Run.md).
