# Overview

This is an **educational** project demonstrating software engineering principles and the agile methodology applicable to building mission-critical solutions. This project encompasses a range of technologies and paradigms:

* Go and ReactJS
* Concurrency
* Databases
* Application Programming Interfaces (API)
* Container
* Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
* Data modelling and algorithm
* and many more.

The objective of this project is to showcase an operational solution that implements data modelling, statistical analysis techniques, data processing techniques and techniques to displaying data to end users.

This project uses UK National Lottery draws data source as a case study. However, it is necessary to emphasise the objective of this project is **not** to deliver a solution to predict lottery wins. If the result generated a winning lottery, it is purely coincidental. If you are seeking a solution to accurately predict lottery winnings, please refer to other projects.
