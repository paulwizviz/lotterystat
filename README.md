This project uses UK National Lottery draws data source as a case study. The choice of Lottery draws to showcase this project is purely arbitary. However, the objective of this project is **not** to deliver a solution to predict lottery wins. If this solution from this project generated a winning lottery, it is purely coincidental. If you are seeking a solution to accurately predict lottery winnings, please refer to other projects.
