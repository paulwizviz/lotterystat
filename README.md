# Overview

The objective of this project is to demonstrate software engineering principles by developing an example application in Go that applies *concurrent programming* and *database integration* techniques.

The example application, named `ebz`, extracts UK national lottery results in CSV format, persists data into SQLite and PostgreSQL, and performs simple statistical analyses, such as frequency analysis (see Figure 1). SQLite is the primary database whilst PostgreSQL is the secondary database.

## Disclaimer

This project uses UK National Lottery draws for illustrative purposes only. It is intended to demonstrate software engineering principles, **not** to predict lottery results.

Please note that this is an evolving project and is subject to changes without prior notice.
