# Overview

This is an **educational** project demonstrating software engineering principles and the agile methodology applicable to building mission-critical solutions. This project encompasses a range of technologies and paradigms:

* Go and ReactJS
* Concurrency
* Databases
* Application Programming Interfaces (API)
* Container
* Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
* Data modelling and algorithm
* and many more.

The project will showcase an operational solution for extracting data from sources to deliver via APIs supporting third-party application developments and a frontend. This project uses UK National Lottery draws as the data source for processing. However, it is necessary to emphasise that the principal purpose of this project is **not** to deliver a solution to help a user better predict the lottery win. If the result generated a winning lottery, it is purely coincidental. If you are seeking a solution to accurately predict lottery winnings, please refer to other solutions.

The project has elected to use the lottery draws as it offered an opportunity to produce code from analytical techniques used to process data.
